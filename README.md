Inspired by Parkour. (https://www.roblox.com/games/445664957/Parkour)

Thank you for downloading this map, i have spent about a week working on it.

Please credit me properly if going to showcase/record this map(link to github in desc, optionally addition of my discord tagfor extra swag points)


Please follow rules for best map expirience.

RULES:

No slam storage.

No gun usage.

Only 3 slam bounces in a row/combo.

No cheats.(unless to get back after fell on the ground or to challange pad)

Use your fucking brain to determinate what is okay and not okay to do.


Bored? No worries, u can try out challanges!

Start challanges from a 2x2 grass pads.(check picture)

I am the speed - Climb THE tower in under 65 seconds. (includes climbing up the poles)

Ground is now optional too - Climb THE tower without touching ground. (without stepping onto rock material, wall jumping allowed)

Testing what? - Climb the test tower in under 45 seconds.

Groundless% - Use every blue whiplash point without touching ground. (without stepping onto rock material)

I hate pipes(and so do i) - Use every blue whiplash point without touching ground (without stepping onto rock material AND props, which means PIPES ONLY)

I AM THE DANGER - Climb THE tower starting from test tower in under 130 seconds.


General tips:

To wallrun, slide/leap onto a wall and hold a or d.

Get a lot of horizontal and vertical momentum by leaping on third slam bounce (2 slam bounces, finish off with a leap)

GLHF!


If got any questions hit me up on discord.

(probably) Expect map expansion.
